This is the repository for Secer et al., 2025. 

The codebase will be cleaned up in the coming weeks.

System requirements: Any MATLAB installed machine should work.
			    The MATLAB installation should include Signal Processing toolbox and Statistics, Machine 			    Learning Toolbox. The system must have a c++ compiler recognized by Matlab (see https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/
			    supported-compilers.html for the list of compilers.)                                    
                                    We tested the code on a MacBook Air with a MATLAB R2024a that has these toolboxes and the compiler Xcode with Clang.

Installation guide: After installing the MATLAB (~ 1hr on a typical computer), change the MATLABâ€™s current path to the path of the repo.
                             Run addpath(genpath(pwd)) followed by findfirst_install.m
		        
                             
Demo and instructions: main_errortheorypaper.m is the main demo file. Inside it, example codes for recalibration and error-correction are provided. Simulating a recalibration process takes about 10-30 mins, depending on the final time of the simulation and other parameters.
